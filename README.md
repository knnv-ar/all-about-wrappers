## 01-max-width-wrapper

Contra: When we reach the limit of 60rem of the max-width, we will get out of left and right margin space. So to fix this, we will go to the next example.

## 02-min-function-wrapper

Contra: it does not allow you to add a full-width background color. So to fix this, we will go to the next example.

## 03-wrapper-inside-parent-element

Contra: we have to include another html element (`<section>`). So to avoid this, we will go to the next example.

## 04-full-bleed-grid-wrapper

Contra: it works well when you hace only one elemente like the `<img>`, but what if you want to have more than one? To do so, we will go to the next example.

## 05-full-bleed-grid-wrapper-with-grid-columns

Contra: it does not have a gap between text and image. So to fix this, we will go to the next example.

## 06-add-gap

Contra: the code written is not good because of the complexity and future maintenance. So to fix this, we will go to the next example using custom properties.
